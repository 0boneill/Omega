ABOUT THIS TOOL
===============

The src/ directory here contains F90 files and a Makefile to produce the
runoff_map executable. The executable reads runoff_map.nml and produces three
maps:

1) An initial nearest neighbor mapping from the rof grid to the coastal ocean
   grid
2) A smoothing map from the coastal ocean grid to the global ocean grid
3) The product of the two, a smooth map from the rof grid to the global ocean
   grid

The ncl/ directory contains an NCL script to compute a fourth map (which is
actually a combination of two existing maps):

4) Map (1) from above for rof grid cells where closest ocean coastal cell in
   in the open ocean, or map (3) if the nearest ocean coastal cell is in a
   marginal sea

====================
HOW TO USE THIS TOOL
====================

1) Build (see the INSTALL file in this directory for details)
2) Setup a namelist file (see any of runoff_map_*.nml for an example)
3) Run with the following command:
$ ./runoff_map < [namelist file]
4) Run ./run_merge_mapping_files.sh (will produce map 4)

====================
NAMELIST FILE FORMAT
====================

The namelist file must be called "runoff_map.nml".  That name is hardwired
into the executable.

The namelist looks like this

where

&input_nml
   gridtype     = 'rtm'
   file_roff    = '/glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/lnd/clm2/rtmdata/rdirc.05.061026'
   file_ocn_global_mask  = '/glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/gx1v7_151008.nc'
   file_ocn_coastal_mask = '/glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/gx1v7_ac_170322.nc'
   file_nn      = 'map_r05_to_gx1v7_ac_nearestdtos_170323.nc '
   file_smooth  = 'map_gx1v7_ac_to_gx1v7_smooth_170323.nc '
   file_new     = 'map_r05_to_gx1v7_nnsm_e1000r300_170323.nc'
   title        = 'runoff map: r05 -> gx1v7, nearest neighbor and smoothed '
   eFold        = 1000000.0
   rMax         =  300000.0
   nn_dest_is_smooth_src = .true.
   step1 = .true.
   step2 = .true.
   step3 = .true.

Input grid files:
  gridtype =  type of file_roff file, "rtm" or "obs" or "scrip"
              * rtm is a 720 x 360 grid ascii file
              * obs is a netcdf file with xc, yc, xv, yv, mask and area variable names
              * scrip is a scrip type grid file (must contain grid_area along with
                typical scrip grid variables)
  file_roff              =   an ascii rdirc file OR an obs rtm file OR a scrip grid file
  file_ocn_global_mask   =  a scrip ocean grid file where the mask is 1 for
                            all ocean grid cells
  file_ocn_coastal_mask  =  a scrip ocean grid file where the mask is only 1
                            for coastal grid cells (if omitted, code will use
                            file_ocn_global_mask instead)
NOTE: both file_ocn_* variables must contain grid_area along with typical scrip
      grid variables

Input parameters:
  eFold = smoothing eFold distance in meters
  rMax  = maximum radius of effect in meters

Settings:
  title                 = ascii string to add to mapping files
  nn_dest_is_smooth_src = option to limit the srouce points for step2 to just
                          the points that get mapped to in step1; if false,
                          use all ocean points in file_ocn_coastal_mask instead
  step1                 = computes nearest neighbor map
  step2                 = computes smooth map
  step3                 = multiple two maps together

Output fields:
  file_nn     = nearest neighbor mapping file
  file_smooth = smoother mapping file
  file_new    = combined file


==========
HOW TO RUN
==========

Execute the binary ./runoff_map (again, this will read the runoff_map.nml
namelist file - see above section for tips on creating the file)
