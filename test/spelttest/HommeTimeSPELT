Underlying timing routine was MPI_Wtime.
Per-call utr overhead est: 6.91414e-08 sec.
If overhead stats are printed, roughly half the estimated number is
embedded in the wallclock stats for each timer.
Print method was most_frequent.
If a '%_of' field is present, it is w.r.t. the first timer for thread 0.
If a 'e6_per_sec' field is present, it is in millions of PAPI counts per sec.

A '*' in column 1 below means the timer had multiple parents, though the
values printed are for all calls. Further down the listing is more detailed
information about multiple parents. Look for 'Multiple parent info'

Multiple parent info (if any) for thread 0:
Columns are count and name for the listed child
Rows are each parent, with their common child being the last entry, which is indented
Count next to each parent is the number of times it called the child
Count next to child is total number of times it was called by the listed parents
