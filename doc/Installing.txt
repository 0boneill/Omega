 */ /*! \page install Installing

PIO uses the gnu autoconf tools, for historical reasons the configure
script is in the pio subdirectory.  Before running configure you will
need to know the location of some supporting libraries. 

Set NETCDF_PATH to the netcdf install directory or --disable-netcdf to
disable serial NetCDF support.

Use the flag --enable-netcdf4 to enable the NetCDF4/HDF5 parallel interface.

Set PNETCDF_PATH to the pnetcdf install directory, this will enable support
for parallel-netcdf

Set CC, FC, MPICC, MPIFC to the serial and parallel c and fortran 90 compiler names.

That should be the minimal set of flags required to build pio, a complete set of flags is available by running configure --help.   

One additional flag of interest is --enable-filesystem-hints which can
be set to gpfs or lustre.  You should only use this flag if you are sure that the
file system you are using is either gpfs or lustre respectively.
