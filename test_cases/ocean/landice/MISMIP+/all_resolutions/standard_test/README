This directory contains config*xml files for each supported resolution of the MISMIP+ experiments.

Note that the files at each resolution are nearly identical, except that each one
points to a difference namelist.input file. It would be better to have a single
config*xml file for all resolutions. But at least for now, any config change at
one resolution must be repeated at the other resolutions.
